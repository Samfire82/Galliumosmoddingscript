Well, i have made a script that can mod GalliumOS for you!
You can edit the script to how you like but if you plan on sharing it to the public, i would appriciate some credit 
You will need to install git if not installed, heres how to install it on ubuntu and debian
sudo apt install git
Once git is installed you'll need to do
sudo git clone https://github.com/Samfire82/Galliumosmoddingscript.git and then cd Galliumosmoddingscript then sudo ./mod.sh 
Thats it! if you want to cancel simply reboot using Refresh+Power or closing terminal 

If something goes wrong with the script, please report an issue and attempt the script again
